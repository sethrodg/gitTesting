# gitTesting
This line should show when I rebase. Created from main on GUI.

This line should show without switching to main and doing a pull. Simply git rebase --pull origin main

This line should showup on main with a git pull, but not on sethTest1

This update is happening from origin, checkout sethTest1 and run git pull origin main --rebase and we should have it.

This line i can pull from main and rebase sethTest1 from main.

Going to commit this line then revert it and it should go back to 10.
